# TK-Workshop Sensor Input Device

*Simple BLE enabled device for embedded systems and mobile pervasive computing workshops.*

####  ðŸ“Œ What's This?
This is a basic embedded systems device that reads data from two sensors, and broadcasts it through Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) to a mobile device or computer. This device and its ecosystem is made as part of the Universitas Multimedia Nusantara (UMN)'s Association of Computer Engineering Students (ACES) program to introduce the fundamentals of embedded systems and mobile pervasive computing to high school students.
